# MoviBeers

## About
MoviBeers is a fun, work-in-progress iOS application that tracks two of life's simple pleasures: movies watched and beers enjoyed! Born from an inside joke between friends, this app lets you log your movie and beer consumption while competing for the longest streaks and highest counts.

## Background
This project started as a lighthearted way to track a running joke between friends about our movie watching and beer drinking habits. I decided to turn the joke into an actual app both for fun and to gain hands-on experience with iOS development, Firebase, and SwiftUI.

## Current Features
- **User Authentication**: Create an account and sign in securely
- **Profile Management**: View and edit your profile, including username customization
- **Social Features**: Follow friends and view their stats
- **Activity Tracking**: Log movies watched and beers consumed
- **Streaks**: Maintain and compete for the longest streaks
- **User Search**: Find and follow other users

## Technical Details
- Built with SwiftUI
- Firebase Authentication and Firestore for backend
- MVVM Architecture

## Status
This is very much a work in progress! I'm building this app in my spare time to improve my iOS development skills while creating something my friends and I can actually use. Expect bugs, unfinished features, and ongoing improvements.

## Purpose
The primary purposes of this app are:
1. Having fun with friends
2. Gaining practical experience with modern iOS development
3. Creating a portfolio project
4. Learning by doing!

## Future Plans
- Activity feed improvements
- Beer and movie ratings
- Integration with movie databases
- Photo uploads for beers
- Statistics and visualizations
- And whatever else seems fun to add!
